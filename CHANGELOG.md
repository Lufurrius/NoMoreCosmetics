# 1.3.0 
 - Should work consistently now. Mostly rewrote to have outright prevent MoreCompany from loading any cosmetics, along with removing related savedata.
    - Cosmetic savedata removal is currently enforced by default, though will be given a config in future.
 - Fixes cosmetics still rendering on players who had previously equipped cosmetics.

# 1.2.0 
 - Rather than updating the Config Values the methods of displaying the cosmetics are disabled. I am learning.

# 1.1.0 
 - Now updates MoreCompany's configs so that cosmetics are not used at launch.

# 1.0.0 
 - Initial Release.
