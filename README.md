### Tired of the glaring green button at the bottom right of your screen?

![Banner](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1084052389025288218/1279268017557213265/guA9HLq.gif?ex=66d3d2af&is=66d2812f&hm=de37d6428e99f20b1469396b967b01869293f0633e2d6f52b39ef0991f94ab69&=)

Then this is a plugin for you! Blow that button to smithereens. It's been almost 10 months since [MoreCompany](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/notnotnotswipez/MoreCompany/) was released and I personally have seen DOZENS of people request a way to remove the button. Yet for some reason it is not yet a feature nor where any patch plugins released. Until now, that is.

This is simple a patch that disables the UI relating to cosmetics and now also prevents any from being loaded! This is **not** an alternative to MoreCompany, it's an add-on patch.

Highly recommended to use in conjunction with DaXcess' [NoMoreCompanyLogo](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DaXcess/NoMoreCompanyLogo/), go check it out! Here's what your title screen will look like when using the patches. Identical to vanilla! Consider using if you have an [Emblem](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Darkbrewery/Emblem/) custom menu.

This is my first ever time using C# and working with BepInEx Plugins, worked my ass off with it.\
Will soon get a public GitHub repo set up.

There are no current known issues. The implementation has been tested with 2 players using "Online" mode and no errors or warns where observed in the logs, nor hits to performance. Please reach out via the thread on the Lethal Company Modding Discord if you run into problems.

Last tested on Lethal Company v62, using MoreCompany v1.10.1
